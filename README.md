## Updating
In order to update the html use the reference default.html and make the changes that you want.
After that use [StatiCrypt](https://robinmoisson.github.io/staticrypt/) to encrypt default.html, make sure you use the same password for the new encryption. Download the new html file and put it in the folder. Copy and paste everything except the script from index.html and replace it in the file you downloaded. Delete index.html and rename the downloaded file to index.html. Make sure it works properly then push to Github.
